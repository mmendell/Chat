This project is centered around building an application with react that will integrate the google calender api to fetch data and events.
this will  be serverless to eliminate the need for maintenance, and will be a pwa to speed up loading and provide a better, smoother user experience.




1.	As a user I the event details should be hidden by default,
When I want to see the details,
I should be able to show them by clicking on them

2.	Each user by default has a number of events displayed in the calendar view
When they would like to set their own view of events\
They can do so 
3.	User data is downloaded to the local cache so when not connected they can still view upcoming events while disconnected
When user adjusts settings
Alert will show up
4.	Events by default are sorted by city
When user wants to view particular cityâ€™s events
clicking will display them
